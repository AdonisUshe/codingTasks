# Online Store Web Application

## Description
This project is a fictional multi-page online store web application built with React and React Router. The application features a navigation menu that allows users to switch between three pages: Home, Products, and About. The Home page includes a login functionality where users can log in by entering their name and log out as needed. This project demonstrates essential React concepts such as state management, event handling, and routing which are crucial for building dynamic web applications. 

## Features
- **Navigation Menu**: A consistent navigation menu appears on every page, allowing users to navigate between Home, Products, and About pages.

  - A 'Login' button that, upon clicking, welcomes the user with a personalized message and changes to a 'Logout' button.
